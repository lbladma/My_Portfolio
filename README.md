## Challenges
There are many challenges that i faced working on this project. However, I was able to overcome most of them either by searching online and by asking for help. 
The main challenge I faced was formatting and styling the elements within the site. 
The other main challenge I faced was debugging and cleaning the code after I finished working on the site.
